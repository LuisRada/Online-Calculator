# Online-Calculator
The objective of this project is to create a program similar to the most popular online mathematical editors, such as Mathway, Photomath, symbolab, Wolfram, etc. Being able to solve different types of mathematical problems, from basic mathematics, geometry, trigonometry, to intermediate - advanced calculus problems. For the correct development of this project, I have decided to divide it into 4 main phases: 
1- Simulation of individual operations: In this first phase the goal is to recreate and solve as many mathematical operations as possible through basic formulas in the source code. 
2- Development and automation: In this second phase, the aim is to improve the solution of mathematical problems (especially in the handling of polynomials), graphics and image guides, as well as the solution procedure (feedback of the procedure), with the implementation of new technologies, such as AI (Artificial Intelligence), ML (Machine Learning), etc. 
3- Development of the programme: In this third stage, the Front-end and Back-end of the program are expected to be developed, using knowledge in HTML, CSS, etc. In addition to using tools such as Docker to compact the different libraries and resources used in the development of the program code.

In this moment the project is in: Phase 1
